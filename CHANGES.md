# Project Changes

## Initial setup
- Scaffolded Expo React Native app with TypeScript and configured module resolver aliases.
- Added global theme utilities (colors, spacing, typography) and a shared `ScreenContainer` layout helper.

## Event browsing experience
- Implemented bottom tab navigation shell and placeholder tabs for Messages and Profile.
- Built events feed with segmented control, sectioned list of sample data, reusable event cards, and empty state routing into creation flow.
- Created a Create Event form view with structured inputs and publish call-to-action.

## SVG illustration update
- Added SVG transformer configuration and typings to load local vector assets.
- Replaced the empty state icon with the provided `create-event.svg` illustration.

## Typography
- Installed Inter font family and load it at app startup.
- Applied Inter font variants across components via the typography theme helpers.
- Standardized letter spacing and line height across all text elements.

## Layout refinements
- Matched event card layout to Figma spacing, ensuring image and content stack align width 321 Ã— 80 frame.
- Added uniform 20px spacing between sections and consistent separation between list rows.
- Prevented section headers from wrapping while keeping them within the viewport.

## Create event workspace
- Removed navigation chrome on the Create route and aligned the form styling with the provided mock, including grey field rows, multi-handle age slider, Today/Tmrw toggle, and modal time picker that hides past time slots for today.
- Added `prop-types` dependency required by the multi-slider control.
- Anchored the Create CTA to the bottom of the screen and restrict the time picker edits to filter only today's past slots.
- Introduced an events context so newly created events appear in the "Your Events" tab with the same card styling as the main feed.
