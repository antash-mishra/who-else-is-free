# Project Changes

## Initial setup
- Scaffolded Expo React Native app with TypeScript and configured module resolver aliases.
- Added global theme utilities (colors, spacing, typography) and a shared `ScreenContainer` layout helper.

## Event browsing experience
- Implemented bottom tab navigation shell and placeholder tabs for Messages and Profile.
- Built events feed with segmented control, sectioned list of sample data, reusable event cards, and empty state routing into creation flow.
- Created a Create Event form view with structured inputs and publish call-to-action.

## SVG illustration update
- Added SVG transformer configuration and typings to load local vector assets.
- Replaced the empty state icon with the provided `create-event.svg` illustration.

## Typography
- Installed Inter font family and load it at app startup.
- Applied Inter font variants across components via the typography theme helpers.
- Standardized letter spacing and line height across all text elements.

## Layout refinements
- Matched event card layout to Figma spacing, ensuring image and content stack align width 321 Ã— 80 frame.
- Added uniform 20px spacing between sections and consistent separation between list rows.
- Prevented section headers from wrapping while keeping them within the viewport.

## Create event workspace
- Removed navigation chrome on the Create route and aligned the form styling with the provided mock, including grey field rows, multi-handle age slider, Today/Tmrw toggle, and modal time picker that hides past time slots for today.
- Added `prop-types` dependency required by the multi-slider control.
- Anchored the Create CTA to the bottom of the screen and restrict the time picker edits to filter only today's past slots.
- Introduced an events context so newly created events appear in the "Your Events" tab with the same card styling as the main feed.

## Backend service
- Added a modular Gin + SQLite server (`server/`) with repository, handlers, and router packages for events.
- Implemented `/api/events` GET/POST endpoints backed by the `event.sqlite` database, including automatic schema migration at startup.

## Frontend & API integration
- Hooked the React Native create flow to the events API so that newly created plans persist through the backend.
- Pulled event listings from the API into the "Your Events" tab, keeping the UI and server data in sync.

## User accounts
- Created a SQLite `users` table with seed demo profiles and a `/api/login` endpoint that authenticates email/password pairs.
- Documented shared API base URL resolution so both authentication and events modules target the same backend host.

## Authentication flow
- Added a dedicated login screen with form validation, seeded credential hints, and loading/error feedback.
- Introduced an auth context and navigation guard so the tab experience loads only after a successful sign in.

## Product vision
- Building a companion-finder that helps people discover last-minute event buddies, create new gatherings, and keep track of their own plans in one place.
